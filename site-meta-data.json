    "description": "Gerrishon Sirere is a Sr. Software Engineer at the New York Times. She specializes in building web experiences, focusing on how we can make our apps work for everyone. Gerrishon's talents include – but are not limited to – saying yes to plans and then forgetting about them later, talking way too loud in quiet places and spotting dogs to say "hello" to. Sometimes he speaks in front of other people, writes about stuff that matters to him, and recently discovered that twitter is a thing."
