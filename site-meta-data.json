    "description": "Yuraima Estevez is a Sr. Software Engineer at the New York Times. She specializes in building web experiences, focusing on how we can make our apps work for everyone. Yuraima's talents include – but are not limited to – saying yes to plans and then forgetting about them later, talking way too loud in quiet places and spotting dogs to say "hello" to. Sometimes she speaks in front of other people, writes about stuff that matters to her, and recently discovered that twitter is a thing."
